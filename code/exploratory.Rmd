# Conventional Soil Map

The conventional soil map that we want to model and extrapolate to poorly accessible areas, taken as our 
target stochastic variable *C*, was submitted to a topology check. All gaps (n = 8) and invalid geometries 
(n = 17) were manually fixed, except for the misfit between the soil map boundary and the boundary of the 
accessible area. The resulting, topologically correct, soil map is shown below.

```{r}
# Load soil map
soil_map <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/MCS_Simplif_Poligon_correct.shp")
soil_map$UM <- as.factor(soil_map$UM)
map <- sp::spplot(
  soil_map, "UM", col.regions = c("firebrick1", "deepskyblue", "lightgray", "khaki"), col = NA,
  main = "Conventional target soil map", aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE))
names(map$legend) <- "inside"
map$legend$inside$x <- 0.50
map$legend$inside$y <- 0.15
map$legend$inside$args$key$space <- "left"
map
```

The area covered by each soil mapping unit in the target conventional soil map is show below. Mapping unit 
CXal has the largest area, while PACd has the smallest area.

```{r}
soil_map_areas <- data.frame(area = rgeos::gArea(soil_map, byid = TRUE), um = soil_map$UM)
soil_map_areas$area <- soil_map_areas$area / 10000
barplot(c(by(soil_map_areas$area, soil_map_areas$um, sum)),
        main = "Area of each mapping unit (ha)")
```

# Field Calibration Points

The database contains three datasets with field soil calibration data. The first is composed of data
from n = 119 complete soil profile description. The second contains soil data from n = 199 boreholes,
one of which lies outside the accessible area. Both of these datasets were used as calibration soil
data to build the conventional soil map. The third dataset is composed of soil data from n = 66 
boreholes. This dataset was originally used for validating the conventional soil map.

```{r}
# Load accessible area
area <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/Lim10000Detal.shp")

# Complete soil profile descriptions (n = 119)
profiles <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/Perfis.shp")
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, col.regions = "gray",
  main = "Complete soil profile descriptions (n = 119)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(profiles), pch = 21, cex = 0.5)
    })

# Borehole soil descriptions (n = 199)
# Identify point lying outside the accessible area
boreholes <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/Tradagens.shp")
in_or_out <- which(is.na(sp::over(boreholes, area)$OBJECTID))
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, 
  col.regions = "gray", main = "Borehole soil descriptions (n = 199)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(boreholes), pch = 21, cex = 0.5)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(boreholes[in_or_out, 1:2]), pch = 20, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
    })

# Boreholes used for validation (n = 66)
validation <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/Tradagens_Validacao.shp")
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, 
  col.regions = "gray", main = "Boreholes used for validation (n = 66)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(validation), pch = 21, cex = 0.5)
    })
```

For the purpose of our study, I propose removing the point lying outside the accessible area. Merging the 
three datasets would result in a final calibration dataset with n = 383 points.

```{r}
# Field calibration dataset (n = 383)
field <- 
  as.data.frame(
    rbind(sp::coordinates(profiles), sp::coordinates(boreholes)[-in_or_out, ], 
          sp::coordinates(validation)))
sp::coordinates(field) <- ~ coords.x1 + coords.x2
sp::proj4string(field) <- sp::proj4string(profiles)
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, col.regions = "gray", 
  main = "Field calibration dataset (n = 383)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(field), pch = 21, cex = 0.5)
    })
```

The number of field calibration sample points per soil mapping unit is shown below.

```{r}
field_cal <- sp::over(field, soil_map)
plot(field_cal$UM, ylim = c(0, 180), main = "Points per mapping unit", cex.axis = 0.8)
text(1:4, summary(field_cal$UM) + 10, summary(field_cal$UM))
```

We can see that theere are
`r round(161/46, 1)` times more calibration points in class `r levels(field_cal$UM)[1]` than in class 
`r levels(field_cal$UM)[3]`. From a statistical perspective, this unbalance is undesirable because prediction
models for categorical responses tend to favour -- to be biased towards -- those classes for which there are
more calibration observations [@Agresti2002; @HairEtAl2010]. This unbalance should also make it more difficult 
for the different classes being modelled to present common variance matrices, a requirement for employing 
linear discriminant analysis [@HastieEtAl2009].

# Random Calibration Points

In one of the scenarios that we simulate, the conventional target soil map is all that we have available. In 
order to model it and extrapolate its spatial structure to poorly accessible areas, we use a stratified random
sample composed of n ~ 2000 points.

```{r}
# Stratified random sample (n ~ 2000)
set.seed(2001)
random <- sp::spsample(soil_map, n = 2000, type = "stratified")
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, col.regions = "gray",
  main = "Stratified random sample (n ~ 2000)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(random), pch = 21, cex = 0.1)
    })
```

The resulting number of sample points allocated to each soil mapping unit is shown below.

```{r}
random_cal <- sp::over(random, soil_map)
plot(random_cal$UM, ylim = c(0, 1000), main = "Points per mapping unit")
text(1:4, summary(random_cal$UM) + 50, summary(random_cal$UM))
```

The larger the area covered by a mapping unit, the larger the number of sample points. Compared to the field
calibration data, this unbalance may result in the same statistical difficulties. However, there are two 
important differences. First, the number of points allocated to the class with the largest area coverage is 
`r round(913/217, 1)` -- instead of only `r round(161/46, 1)` -- times larger than the number of points
allocated to the class with the smallest area coverage. Last, the number of points allocated to classes 
`r levels(field_cal$UM)[4]` and `r levels(field_cal$UM)[2]` reflects more accurately the area covered by these
two classes. This is an indication that field observations were biased towards classes 
`r levels(field_cal$UM)[3]` and `r levels(field_cal$UM)[4]`.

# Expert Calibration Points

The last calibration dataset is composed of soil data from n = 847 points manually allocated by an expert on
the computer screen. The spatial distribution of these sample points is shown below.

```{r}
# Expert calibration points (n = 847)
expert <- raster::shapefile("data/vector/Trein_Classes.shp")

# See how many are outside the accessible area
in_or_out <- sp::over(expert, area)
sp::spplot(
  area, 1, aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = TRUE), colorkey = FALSE, col.regions = "gray",
  main = "Expert calibration points (n = 847)",
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(expert), pch = 21, cex = 0.5)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(expert[which(is.na(in_or_out$OBJECTID)), ]),
                          pch = 20, cex = 0.5, col = "red")
    
    })
in_or_out <- length(which(is.na(in_or_out$OBJECTID))) / length(in_or_out$OBJECTID)
```

This dataset has some features that require our attention. First, `r round(in_or_out * 100)` percent of the 
points lie outside the accessible area (red points above). Second, the expert assigned the sample points to
five classes, while our target variable (the conventional soil map) has only four classes (mapping units). A
visual inspection of the soil map and classes attributed to the sample points suggest that classes 2 and 3 are 
equivalent to class `r levels(field_cal$UM)[2]`.

```{r}
sp::spplot(
  soil_map, "UM", aspect = "iso", scales = list(draw = FALSE), colorkey = FALSE, 
  col.regions = c("firebrick1", "deepskyblue", "lightgray", "khaki"), col = NA,
  main = "Zoom in the expert calibration points", ylim = c(9460143, 9461942), xlim = c(240125, 243075),
  panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    sp::panel.polygonsplot(x, y, ...)
    lattice::panel.points(sp::coordinates(expert), pch = 20)
    lattice::panel.text(sp::coordinates(expert)[, 1], sp::coordinates(expert)[, 2], 
                        expert@data$MDS, pos = 2)
    })
```

If the match between attributes classes and my guesses are correct, then we can compute the number of points
per mapping unit.

```{r}
expert$UM <- as.factor(expert$MDS)
levels(expert$UM) <- levels(random_cal$UM)[c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4)]
plot(expert$UM, ylim = c(0, 320), main = "Points per mapping unit")
text(1:4, summary(expert$UM) + 25, summary(expert$UM))
```

Again, the number of points is correlated with the area of the mapping unit. However, the observed proportions
are considerably different from those of the field and random calibration samples, as well as of the area 
covered by each mapping unit. The ratio between the number of calibration points in mapping units 
`r levels(expert$UM)[1]` and `r levels(expert$UM)[3]` is only `r round(280/107, 1)`. For mapping units
`r levels(expert$UM)[4]` and `r levels(expert$UM)[2]`, the ratio is now only `r round(234/226, 2)`. Also, the
number of points allocated by the expert to mapping unit `r levels(expert$UM)[1]` is only `r round(280/234, 2)`
times larger than the number of points allocated to mapping unit `r levels(expert$UM)[4]`. This suggests that
the allocation of calibration points in the expert dataset was biased towards mapping units 
`r levels(expert$UM)[2]`, `r levels(expert$UM)[3]` and `r levels(expert$UM)[4]`. The positive side of this 
bias is that mapping unit `r levels(expert$UM)[1]` will likely be less favoured during the estimation of model
parameters.

# Covariates

A set of *p* = 11 covariates was included in the database: elevation, slope, curvature, plan curvature, 
profile curvature, downslope flow length, upslope flow length, flow accumulation, flow direction, aspect and
topographic wetness index. All covariate data in the database matches the description presented by
@Villela2013. However, there are some details worth mentioning regarding the data quality and structure, and 
the nature of the covariates and their possible relation with the soil spatial distribution in the study area.

## Aspect and flow direction data

It appears that the **aspect** data was used by @Villela2013 as is, i.e. without linearising its values.
Linearisation is necessary because aspect is a circular variable, by which I mean that its minimum (0º) and
maximum (360º) values have exactly the same physical meaning. Linearisation can be accomplished using the
following equation:

$$northerness = |180 - aspect| / 180$$

where **northerness** is a variable that indicates the degree of exposition of a surface to the north, with 
values 0 and 1 indicating minimum and maximum exposition, respectively. Another solution is to transform the
aspect data to categories, i.e. classes of orientation. However, this would make the use of linear 
discriminant analysis inappropriate because the assumption of multivariate normality would not hold any more 
[@PressEtAl1978]. In general, linear logistic regression is used in such circumstances because it makes no 
assumption about the probability distribution function of the predictor variables [@PressEtAl1978; 
@HarrellEtAl1985; @MichieEtAl1994; @JohnsonEtAl2008].

The way I see it, the reason for using aspect as a covariate in soil prediction models is the hypothesis that 
it could determine the availability of water in the environment. I am not sure if this effect is significant 
in the Amazon region, specially in a study area with a range in elevation values of 46--84 m, where the the 
drainage network runs, predominantly, from south to north. In general, aspect data has a marked influence on
soil and other environmental features in higher latitudes, beyond the tropics, and in mountainous terrain
[@OliphantEtAl2003]. As such, I believe there is no strong pedological reason for using it as a covariate in
our study.

It is also not clear to me how the **flow direction** data was used in the analysis. It appears that this
covariate was used as is, i.e. taking its finite set of eight integer values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) 
as a continuous covariate. As far as I understand, the correct approach would be to use this covariate as a
categorical covariate, whereby each of the eight possible integer values would be defined as a unique 
category. However, like aspect, this would rule out multivariate normality, making the use of linear
discriminant analysis inappropriate. Adding to that, I believe there is no strong pedological reason for using
flow direction as a covariate in our study because it carries virtually the same information already provided
by aspect.

**NOTE**: A previous version of the northerness data gave evidence of the presence of spurious depressions in
the digital elevation model at places of high elevation (see figure bellow). I believe that these depressions
were created due to the presence of contour lines with erroneous elevation values at some of the higher parts
of the landscape. As such, elevated places, possibly hilltops, presented high values of the topographic wetness
index. These depressions in the digital elevation model could represent true, existing depressions. However, 
because there is no evidence of the existence of such depressions at higher elevations in the study area, the
original digital elevation model had to be processed to eliminate all spurious artefacts before deriving all 
covariates once again.

elevation values in a depression.](fig/north_sinks.png)

## Curvature data

The covariate dataset contains three covariates describing the landscape curvature: horizontal curvature,
vertical curvature and compound curvature. Because these covariates describe very similar features of the 
landscape, their correlation is generally moderate to high, giving rise to a strong multicollinearity. 
Multicollinearity has a negative effect on linear models because it causes the explosion of the variance of
estimated parameters [@FarrarEtAl1967]. Despite this does not genneraly affect fitted and predicted values 
[@KutnerEtAl2004], it causes large instability of the estimated parameters, which affects stepwise variable 
selection methods [@Harrell2001a]. This negative effect adds to the fact that the multiple comparisons 
employed by stepwise methods increase the chance of including irrelevant predictors in the model, yielding 
almost meaningless *P*-values [@Harrell2001a] -- the chance of including a covariate with low discriminatory 
power is much larger than the significance level [@SASInstituteInc2013].

In order to avoid the negative effects of multicollinearity, I believe that only one of the covariates
describing the landscape curvature should be used to calibrate our soil prediciton models. Optimally, this 
covariate should be selected based on pedological knowledge and empirical evidence. The latter suggests that
**compound curvature** is the most corralated with the observed soil spatial variation in our study area. It
remains to be discussed if the use of this covariate is supported by the existing pedological knowledge too.
Considering that (given the resolution of the digital elevation model):

1. most landforms have relatively small dimensions, both verticaly and horizontaly, reflecting the small range 
   of elevation values -- for example, most of the slopes are relatively short, with a distance of about 50 m 
   from toeslope to shoulder,
2. the area occupied with nearly level to gently sloping terrain is considerably large, an information
   depicted in virtualy the same manner by all three curvature related covariates, and
3. the target soil map is relatively coarse, with only four soil mapping units, some of which are delineated
   mostly based on the identification of areas of larger potential of water accumulation and flow,
   irrespective of its direction and velocity,

it seems reasonable to suggest that using only informaton on the compound curvature is more pedologically 
sound than exploring all three curvature related covariates. These features of the study area and target 
soil variable raise the question whether compound curvature would not be a more efficient predictor if 
included in the linear soil prediction models as a categorical covariate. In fact, this was the approach 
employed by @Villela2013 when depicting the curvature information. There, the compound curvature was classified
into three classes (convergent/concave, parallel/straight and divergent/convex), which were then related with 
the soil taxa observed on the landscape. The downside of using the compound curvature as a categorical 
covariate to increase its predictive power is that the assumption of multivariate normality made when using 
linear discriminant analysis would not be met. The solution would be to use logistic regression instead, 
a technique that does not make assumptions about the predictor variables [@Harrell2001a].

**NOTE**: A previous version of the curvature data gave further evidence for the presence of spurious 
artefacts in the digital elevation model (see figure below). There was a considerable amount of noise in the
form of stairs along the slopes resulting from the use of contour lines to generate the digital elevation
model. This noise is a typical feature of digital elevation models produced using contour lines. These 
artefacts could be one of the reason for the noise (salt-and-pepper) observed in the spatial predictions made 
by @Villela2013, which were later removed using a majority filter. As far as I understand, this is an 
suboptimal solution: "imperfections" in the resulting soil map is a result of the poor quality of the input 
data. A more appropriate solution was employed here, which consists of applying a smoothing filter with a 
three by three window on the digital elevation model before deriving all terrain attributes once again.

![Noise in curvature data caused by the use of contour lines to compute the digital elevation model. The 
solution is to use a smoothing filter to remove the noise from the digital elevation model before deriving 
terrain attributes.](fig/curvature_contours.png)

## Flow length and accumulation

Another two covariates used by @Villela2013 are also strongly correlated: **flow accumulation** and 
**upslope flow path length**. For a given cell, the first is defined as the area that contribute to the flow 
that reaches it, while the second is defined as the distance covered by that flow. Both are determined by the
cell size and the number of cells that contribute to the flow. The main mathematical difference between these
two covariates is their measurement units: metres, for upslope flow path length, and square metres, for 
flow accumulation. This leads to the conclusion that they are proxies of the same environmental condition: the
potential that the different parts of the landscape have of accumulating water. Being strongly correlated, it
would be wise to include only one of these covariates in our soil prediction models.

Finally, it is not clear to me how flow accumulation and upslope flow path length data were used by
@Villela2013. Despite it is not mentioned in the text, the figures 33 and 35 suggest that both were 
transformed using a logarithmic function.
